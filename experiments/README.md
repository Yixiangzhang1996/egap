The directory [extLcp](https://github.com/felipelouza/egap/tree/master/experiments/extLcp) contains a snapshot of the code from repository [BCR_LCP_GSA](https://github.com/giovannarosone/BCR_LCP_GSA) that we used to compare the running times with the eGap algorithm.

With respect to the original code we changed the string terminator symbol in the output BWT to 0x0 and we added the Python wrapper extLcp which has a user interface similar to eGap.
